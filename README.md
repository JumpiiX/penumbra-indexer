**High-Level Description of the Real-Time Blockchain Indexer**

### **1. Overview**
With my background in Rust development at Brack and extensive experience with **Tokio**, I have chosen to build a real-time blockchain indexer using Rust's async capabilities. While I initially considered WebSockets—given my familiarity with them—I ultimately decided against it in favor of best practices, ensuring a scalable and efficient architecture using **gRPC**.

### **2. Core Components**

#### **1. Blockchain Listener (gRPC Client)**
- Connects to the Penumbra blockchain’s public gRPC node.
- Listens for new blocks in real-time and retrieves raw block data.
- Implements **Tokio’s async runtime** for high-performance streaming.

#### **2. Data Processing Layer (Parser & Transformer)**
- Extracts relevant information from raw block data (block height, timestamp, transactions, block hash).
- Converts data into a structured format suitable for storage.
- Handles potential chain reorganizations (forks) to maintain data integrity.

#### **3. Storage Layer (PostgreSQL Database)**
- Stores indexed block data in a structured relational database.
- Uses optimized indexing for fast lookups and query performance.
- Implements schema migrations to accommodate future changes.

#### **4. API Layer (REST/GraphQL)**
- Exposes a private API for querying indexed data.
- Supports fetching the latest N blocks with metadata.
- Implements rate limiting and authentication for security.

#### **5. Caching & Performance Optimization**
- Uses Redis for caching frequently accessed queries.
- Implements batch inserts to optimize database writes.
- Uses database indexing to enhance query performance.

#### **6. Logging & Monitoring**
- Logs system activity and errors for debugging.
- Implements metrics collection (e.g., Prometheus) for system health monitoring.
- Alerts on failures such as connection loss to the blockchain node.

### **3. Technologies & Frameworks**
- **Rust:** Core programming language for performance and memory safety.
- **gRPC (`tonic`)**: Enables high-performance blockchain communication.
- **SQLX (PostgreSQL)**: Provides async database access and structured storage.
- **Warp or Actix-Web:** Used to build the API for querying indexed data.
- **Redis (Optional):** Enhances caching for frequently queried data.
- **Docker & Kubernetes:** Ensures deployment and scalability.

### **4. Workflow**
1. **Blockchain Listener** receives new blocks via gRPC.
2. **Data Processing Layer** extracts and transforms relevant data.
3. **Storage Layer** persists the structured data in PostgreSQL.
4. **API Layer** serves data to applications for querying.
5. **Monitoring & Logging** ensure system reliability and debugging capabilities.

### **5. Deployment & Scalability**
- Uses **Docker** for containerization and reproducibility.
- Deployed on **Kubernetes** for horizontal scaling.
- Implements **load balancing** for high-availability APIs.

### **6. Conclusion**
Building on my Rust and async programming expertise, I have designed this real-time blockchain indexer for efficiency, scalability, and best-practice architecture. By leveraging **Tokio** and **gRPC**, I ensure reliable real-time data processing while maintaining performance through caching, indexing, and proper database optimization. This system enables fast, reliable access to blockchain transaction data with a structured and maintainable approach.
